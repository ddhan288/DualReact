1. What is a React component?
a function that returns react elements or UI 

the function returns the html element in the form of jsx and the createElement function return the javascript objects which interpret and turn into real DOM under the hoood

React is component is a  pieace of reusable code  or a section of a website for example a navbar  footer .. which we write once and we can it whereever  we need the same piece of code .

2. What's wrong with this code?
```
function myComponent() {
    return (
        <small>I'm tiny text!</small>
    )
}
```
the function name should be in Pascal case. as it is a component.

3. What's wrong with this code?
```
function Header() {
    return (
        <header>
            <img src="./react-logo.png" width="40px" alt="React logo" />
        </header>
    )
}

root.render(Header())
```
the Header component is not being called in the root.render()
rather it should be called like in the form of react component  <Header/>
